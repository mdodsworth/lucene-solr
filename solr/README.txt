Welcome to the Apache Solr project!
-----------------------------------

Solr is the popular, blazing fast open source enterprise search platform
from the Apache Lucene project.

For a complete description of the Solr project, team composition, source
code repositories, and other details, please see the Solr web site at
http://lucene.apache.org/solr


Getting Started
---------------

To start Solr for the first time after installation, simply do:

  bin/solr start -f

This will launch a Solr server in the foreground of your shell, bound
to port 8983. Alternatively, you can launch Solr in "cloud" mode,
which allows you to scale out using sharding and replication. To
launch Solr in cloud mode, do:

  bin/solr start -f -cloud

To see all available options for starting Solr, please do:

  bin/solr start -help

After starting Solr, direct your Web browser to the Solr Admin Console at:

  http://localhost:8983/solr/

To add documents to the index, use the post.jar (or post.sh script) in
the example/exampledocs subdirectory (while Solr is running), for example:

     cd example/exampledocs
     java -jar post.jar *.xml
Or:  sh post.sh *.xml

For more information about Solr examples please read...

 * example/solr/README.txt
   For more information about the "Solr Home" and Solr specific configuration
 * http://lucene.apache.org/solr/tutorial.html
   For a Tutorial using this example configuration
 * http://wiki.apache.org/solr/SolrResources
   For a list of other tutorials and introductory articles.


In addition, Solr ships with several example configurations that
help you learn about Solr. To run one of the examples, you would do:

  bin/solr -e <EXAMPLE> where <EXAMPLE> is one of:

    cloud        : SolrCloud example
    dih          : Data Import Handler (rdbms, mail, rss, tika)
    schemaless   : Schema-less example (schema is inferred from data during indexing)
    techproducts : Kitchen sink example providing comprehensive examples of Solr features


A tutorial is available at:

   http://lucene.apache.org/solr/tutorial.html

or linked from "docs/index.html" in a binary distribution.

Also, there are Solr clients for many programming languages, see 
   http://wiki.apache.org/solr/IntegratingSolr


Files included in an Apache Solr binary distribution
----------------------------------------------------

server/
  A self-contained Solr instance, complete with a sample
  configuration and documents to index. Please see: bin/solr start -help
  for more information about starting a Solr server.

example/
  Contains example documents and an alternative Solr home
  directory containing examples of how to use the Data Import Handler,
  see example/example-DIH/README.txt for more information.

dist/solr-<component>-XX.jar
  The Apache Solr libraries.  To compile Apache Solr Plugins,
  one or more of these will be required.  The core library is
  required at a minimum. (see http://wiki.apache.org/solr/SolrPlugins
  for more information).

docs/index.html
  The Apache Solr Javadoc API documentation and Tutorial


Instructions for Building Apache Solr from Source
-------------------------------------------------

1. Download the Java SE 7 JDK (Java Development Kit) or later from http://java.sun.com/
   You will need the JDK installed, and the $JAVA_HOME/bin (Windows: %JAVA_HOME%\bin) 
   folder included on your command path. To test this, issue a "java -version" command 
   from your shell (command prompt) and verify that the Java version is 1.7 or later.

2. Download the Apache Ant binary distribution (1.8.2+) from 
   http://ant.apache.org/  You will need Ant installed and the $ANT_HOME/bin (Windows: 
   %ANT_HOME%\bin) folder included on your command path. To test this, issue a 
   "ant -version" command from your shell (command prompt) and verify that Ant is 
   available. 

   You will also need to install Apache Ivy binary distribution (2.2.0) from 
   http://ant.apache.org/ivy/ and place ivy-2.2.0.jar file in ~/.ant/lib -- if you skip 
   this step, the Solr build system will offer to do it for you.

3. Download the Apache Solr distribution, linked from the above web site. 
   Unzip the distribution to a folder of your choice, e.g. C:\solr or ~/solr
   Alternately, you can obtain a copy of the latest Apache Solr source code
   directly from the Subversion repository:

     http://lucene.apache.org/solr/versioncontrol.html

4. Navigate to the "solr" folder and issue an "ant" command to see the available options
   for building, testing, and packaging Solr.
  
   NOTE: 
   To see Solr in action, you may want to use the "ant example" command to build
   and package Solr into the server/webapps directory. See also server/README.txt.


Export control
-------------------------------------------------
This distribution includes cryptographic software.  The country in
which you currently reside may have restrictions on the import,
possession, use, and/or re-export to another country, of
encryption software.  BEFORE using any encryption software, please
check your country's laws, regulations and policies concerning the
import, possession, or use, and re-export of encryption software, to
see if this is permitted.  See <http://www.wassenaar.org/> for more
information.

The U.S. Government Department of Commerce, Bureau of Industry and
Security (BIS), has classified this software as Export Commodity
Control Number (ECCN) 5D002.C.1, which includes information security
software using or performing cryptographic functions with asymmetric
algorithms.  The form and manner of this Apache Software Foundation
distribution makes it eligible for export under the License Exception
ENC Technology Software Unrestricted (TSU) exception (see the BIS
Export Administration Regulations, Section 740.13) for both object
code and source code.

The following provides more details on the included cryptographic
software:
    Apache Solr uses the Apache Tika which uses the Bouncy Castle generic encryption libraries for
    extracting text content and metadata from encrypted PDF files.
    See http://www.bouncycastle.org/ for more details on Bouncy Castle.
